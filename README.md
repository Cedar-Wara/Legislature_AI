# Legislature_AI

This is my fall senior capstone piece, working with Leah Mordehai to create an AI tool to simplify complicated legal text into easy to read, simple text.


It is built using the Legiscan API key; data tagged and organized by leah mordehai, [insert other names here]; and code by @cedar-wara.

It's purpose is to assist in understanding legislature that has been passed.
